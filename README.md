# GroupChat
Professional corporate-based social network, allowing communication and collaboration through user defined groups.

Once a user creates an account, they can create or join existing groups to engage in discussion with others. Groups can made for companies, corporate departments, online communities, student classes, project collaboration, or general discussion with friends.

Users can post updates inside each group. Comments can then be made and are nested under the relevant posts. Each group required an administrator (automatically defined on group creation).
